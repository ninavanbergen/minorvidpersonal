      <h1>First period</h1>
      <article class="tekstje">
        Which includes the subjects Typography,
        'Beeldtaal' (exploring the real meaning behind
        a picture), and Project Design 1. This period was a lot about learning theories and
        discovering your vision on those theories and meanings. We had to work with those and made
        a lot of work around it.

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p class="typo" >For this subject we had to walk through Amsterdam and discover typographies, and after that we had to
      choose a typography to investigate. After that we had to make a folder/poster about the typography and its
      background.
      <br><br>
      We searched the streets of Amsterdam, nearby the school and we've found some pretty nice ones.
    I had found a board of tiles on a wall with "Eerste Hollansche Levensverzekeringsbank" on it,
  which means the first dutch life insurance bank. The typography was inspired by the 1920's, so my
folder/poster was about the "Roaring Twenties", or "La Belle Epoque". The color I chose was dankbrown/red
because those colors are a little bit more chique and classy. Here is a picture of my foler, front and back.  </p>

    <h2>'Beeldtaal'</h2>
    <p class="beeldtaal">
    For this subject we learned about the meaning behind a picture or poster. So we worked with theories like
  "Ehots" and "Pathos", but also "indexical signs", substitution, Gestalt theory and many more. In the end we had
to design a poster which inclused a lot of those theories we learned about. The picture below is my poster and my
explanation (Dutch). </p>

    <h2>Project Design 1</h2>
    <p class="p1">For the first project we had to make a photo collection about something you're interested in.
    My collection was about real and fake laughing. So I searched for a lot of pictures of people with a real smile
  but also pictures with people on it that are fake smiling. I wanted people to learn about the differences between
a fake and a real smile. After you've collected your photos, you had to make a publication from your collection of
photos and your information about the subject. Click the link below to see my publiation. </p>
