      <h1>Second period</h1>
      <article class="tekstje">
        Which includes the subjects Grid and Colour,
        Interface and Movement (making animations),
        and Project Design 2. During this period we learned a lot about designing the best layout and color
        combinations for your website. We also practiced with animation tools and eventually made our own website
        about everything we've learned in this period.

    <h2>Grid and Colour</h2>
    <p class="gridc">For this subject, we had to make a website about a color of choice. I had
      orange so I had to make an interface about the color orange. It was up to
      you to decide what kind of subjects about orange you wanted to highlight
      on the website. Mine was about culture and nature. <br><br>
Down here is the home page. We had to make the interface for more devices, like
desktop, iPad, and iPhone. We also had to think about grids and outlines. I used
grids as you can see. My prototype is made in Adobe XD.</p>

    <h2>Interface and Movement</h2>
    <p class="im">For this subject we had to made an animation about something you've designed.
    I've worked with Adobe After effects and Illustrator, to design the character and context,
  and to animate it. We first learned about the different ways to animate your design, for example
with coding HTML/CSS, but also with the programmes Animate and After Effects. <br><br> Because I've worked
with After Effects before, I chose that one to make my animation in. I also wanted to increase my skills
while working with After Effects. So my animation was about a little monster namend Franky. Throughout my
animation you can feed him, put him to sleep and dance with him. Down below is a link to my prototype</p>

     <h2>Project Design 2</h2>
     <p class="p2">Project 2 was a continuation of the first project. We had to make the first project
     digital and interactive. We had to think about the grid and colour choices, animations and layout.
   Mine was about real and fake laughing so I filmed my sister while she was real laughing and fake laughing.
 That became my intro of the website. After that I made some short shots of her laughing so that I could explain
the differences clearly. Down below is my prototype</p>
