      <h1>Third period</h1>
      <article class="tekstje">
        Which includes the subjects Web Typography,
        Web Animation (HTML/CSS), and Project Design 3. We learned more about HTML/CSS animations
        and a lot about web typography. In the end we had to make a website which
        includes everything we've learned from the past periods.

    <h2>Web Typography</h2>
    <p class="webtypo">This subject was about designing an interface for deaf people. How to make it as
    interesting as posssible so that the deaf users also have the same (or almost the same) experience as not deaf people.
  We got a scene from a famous movie, and we had to redesign the subtitles so that you can actually see what kind of
tensions or sounds where present. We had to make the invisible visible for the user's eye. Down below is a link to my prototype.</p>

    <h2>Web Animation</h2>
      <p class="webani">For this subject we had to choose a poster and made it digital and interactive.
      So we used HTML/CSS/JS to make it a website and to design it just like the real poster. I chose one
    that had many arrows and stars. We had to work with SVG's to I first designed alle the elements in Adobe Illustrator
  and exported them as an SVG. I've never worked with SVG's before this subject so I had spent a lot of time figuring
that out. But it worked in the end. <br><br> After I made my poster online, I needed to animate it to make it interactive. So all
the arrows are clickable and if you click on one of them, it will rotate and the information text will be visible. All those little stars
are rotating infinitely and change to the color pink if you click on them. They also spin a little faster after clicking.
<br><br> The interface had to be responsible, so I've worked with breakpoints to define my screen types. I designed my protoype for
desktop, Ipad and Iphone. <br> Also, if you hover on one of those arrows, the arrow becomes pink. I also designed some key interactions,
for example, if you press 1, the backround color will change, and if you press 6, something else will happen. I made a lot of key interactions to make
it more fun. </p>

    <h2>Project Design 3</h2>
      <p class="p3">For the last project, we had to choose an online article about something you like, and we had to turn that
      into an online interactive design. I chose an article from The Correspondent, written by Vera Mulder. The article was about
    someone Vera Mulder met in Surinam, named Kenny. I designed a website around Vera Mulder and made it an online platform with
  all her articles about someone she has met in her life. <br><br> It starts with a big map of the world, and little dots on places that she went to.
You can click on those dots to see what kind of people she met there and after that you can click on those peoples to read the artcile Vera made about
them. I designed the article about Kenny, and made it interactive. I chose to design the article in a suiting context, the place she describes in her article.
