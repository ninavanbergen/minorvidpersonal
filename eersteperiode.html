    <h2>The trip to London</h2>
    <p class="londontekst">In febuary we went to London for a couple of days to explore the city,
    and to discover typography in the town. Also, we went to a lot of museums and expositions and we got
  time to explore the city on our own. <p> Before we went to London, we got some assignments that we needed to make
there. At the end of the week, we had to show our assignments to the teachers. One assignment was about discovering
different typographies in the city, so we had to walk through te city and we needed to look around to see if there
were any special typographies on traffic signs, street signs etc. The other assignment had something to do with the
museum we went to. We analized a poster of choice and discussed if there were any of the theories we learned
from the subject "Beeld en Taal". </p><p> In our own free time, we went to see the bridge and did a little bit of shopping. We slept in a big hostel,
with alle the girls in one room. I had a good time in London those couple days, but I was also glad to be home afterwards. Down below are the 360
degrees photos we needed to make for an assignment.</p></p>
